Data and analysis for the manuscript "The mouse gastric surface epithelial cell and its response to early Helicobacter pylori infection".

R version 4.3.2 is used. Renv is used for package version control.

Some results might vary in the output folders from the results presented in the manuscript. If this is the case then the reason is that the script has been run at different times. The files in the commits 2025-05-08 are from a script re-run on the the first submission date on a system with freeshly installed R 4.3.2 with no packages installed, and with commit c2007e2 freshly cloned, in order to ensure other people can run the script and to help make the analysis as reproducible as possible. The reason why results might vary between runs is that there may be dependency packages and linked databases not fully defined in this github repository that may have been updated between script runs.
